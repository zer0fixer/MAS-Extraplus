Hello, it's good to see you again. To simplify, this submod adds a little bit of everything, hence the name Extra+ or ExtraPlus, whichever you prefer to call it, so you can enjoy it with your Monika even though it has little content. I have several ideas in mind to implement here or in another submod. Currently, it is in beta phase, so several things may change before the stable release.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 **Play new Minigames:** Enjoy new games with Monika to pass the time.
- 🥰 **Boop Monika:** Unlock a cute new interaction to boop Monika on the nose.
- 📅 **Go on Dates:** Take Monika on special dates outside of the spaceroom.
- ➕ **Explore new Additions:** Discover secrets, new dialogue, and other small surprises.

## 🚀 Usage & Affection Requirements

To unlock the features of Extraplus, you will need to earn Monika's affection:

- **Dating:** Requires `400` affection points.
- **"Boop" interaction:** Requires `100` affection points.
- **Minigames:** Requires `30` affection points.

> 💡 **Tip:** To get your own Chibika, go to the `Additions` menu and select the `Hi [Your Name]!` option. This will make her appear, and you can then customize her with accessories and outfits.

## 💾 Installation

This guide will walk you through the installation process. Please follow the steps carefully.

### ⚠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:
* A stable and working installation of **Monika After Story**. It is highly recommended to be on the latest official version of MAS.
* You have downloaded the latest release of **Extraplus** from the [Releases](https://github.com/zer0fixer/MAS-Extraplus/releases) page.

### 📓 Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Download and Unzip the File**
    * Download the `.zip` file for the latest release from the link above.
    * Once downloaded, unzip the file using a program like 7-Zip or WinRAR. You will see a `game/` folder inside.

2.  **Locate Your DDLC Directory**
    * Navigate to your main *Doki Doki Literature Club* directory. This is the root folder that contains `DDLC.exe`.

3.  **Copy and Paste the 'game' Folder**
    * Copy the `game/` folder from the unzipped submod files.
    * Paste this folder directly into your *Doki Doki Literature Club* root directory.

4.  **Merge and Replace Files**
    * Your operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.) will detect that there is already a `game/` folder. It will ask if you want to merge the contents and/or replace files.
    * **You must select "YES"** to merge the folders and overwrite any conflicting files. This will add the submod's files into your existing game directory without deleting your progress.

### ✔️ Post-Installation Check

To confirm the submod is working correctly, start *Monika After Story*. After Monika greets you and the main interface loads, you should see a new button labeled **"Extra+"** on the screen. If you see this button, the installation was successful! Enjoy!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: I'm getting the message "The files are not available...". What should I do?**<br>
**A:** This error usually means that some files were not copied correctly. Please try reinstalling the submod, making sure to copy and replace all files as instructed.

**Q: I'm getting the message "Because there is a 'game' folder in the submod...". What does this mean?**<br>
**A:** This is caused by an incorrect installation method. Please refer to the video below for the correct procedure.

**Q: I'm on version 1.3.1 or higher and something isn't working.**<br>
**A:** The old file checker was removed in version 1.3.1. Please double-check that you have followed the installation instructions exactly, as this submod adds files to the `game/mod_assets/monika/a` folder, not just the `submods` folder.

**Q: My game is installed in OneDrive, and it's crashing or images are missing. Why?**<br>
**A:** This is a very common problem caused by how OneDrive manages files. To save space, OneDrive moves game files to the cloud, leaving shortcuts on your computer. The game can't access these cloud files, which causes it to crash.

1. The solution is to move your game out of any OneDrive-synced folders.

2. Create a new folder on a local drive, for example, C:\Games.

3. Copy your entire DDLC folder into this new location.

4. Run the game from the new folder. This should fix the issue permanently.

**Q: I installed the game through Steam, and some features (like creating gifts) don't work.**<br>
**A:** Steam often installs games in protected system folders (like Program Files). These folders can have write-restrictions, preventing the submod from creating new files. Steam's cloud sync can also sometimes cause issues similar to OneDrive.

1. For the best experience with mods, the community strongly recommends using a standalone copy of DDLC outside of Steam.

2. Download a fresh copy of DDLC for free from the official website: ddlc.moe.

3. Extract it to a simple folder, like on your Desktop or C:\Games\.

4. Install MAS and your submods there. This will prevent almost all permission-related errors.

## 🎨 Chibika Accessories - Feature Status

**Important Note:** The feature to add custom accessories to Chibika has been **temporarily disabled** in recent versions.

This is due to technical issues where the accessories folder was not being recognized correctly by the game. I am actively working on a solution to bring this feature back in a more stable way in the future.

For now, Chibika will use the base sprites and appearances included in the submod. Thank you for your patience!

>If this submod is edited by another person and sends that modification to the community, I am not responsible for the errors that it presents by what the other person coded. That's why I put in the submod a button to send it here so you can see what's new in this submod, thanks for your attention.
