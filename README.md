# Extra Plus (1.0.3)
A submod that adds small additions to Monika After Story (MAS), something that should be clarified is that I have not yet been reviewed by the developers so it is possible that bugs may occur. But it will take me enough time to make everything functional, there is no release date yet.

## Warning

If this submod is edited by another person and sends that modification to the community, I am not responsible for the errors that it presents by what the other person coded. That's why I put in the submod a button to send it here so you can see what's new in this submod, thanks for your attention.
